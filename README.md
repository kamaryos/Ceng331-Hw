# Haskell-Tests

So I started to work on some Haskell projects for our Programming Language Concepts lectures.

I will update after every homework finished.

First homework is about the famous hunter-prey problems.
It takes two input. First is the map which includes hunter, prey and obstacles (if there are).
Second one takes the direction which will be handled by the hunter and prey in order.



To be continued...
